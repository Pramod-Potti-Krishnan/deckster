# Round 22 Backend Changes - Frontend Team Reference

## 🎯 What Changed for Frontend

### 1. ✅ Greeting Detection Now Works
- **Input**: "hi", "hello", "hey", etc.
- **Output**: Friendly greeting message with suggestions
- **Example Response**:
```json
{
  "type": "info",
  "content": {
    "message": "Hello! I'm Deckster, your AI presentation assistant. 🎯\n\nI can help you create professional presentations on any topic. Just tell me what you'd like to present about, and I'll guide you through creating something amazing!\n\nWhat topic would you like to explore?",
    "context": "greeting",
    "options": ["Business presentation", "Educational content", "Technical overview", "Sales pitch", "Project update"],
    "question_id": null
  }
}
```

### 2. ✅ Questions Now Have Message Content
- **Fixed**: Empty question messages
- **Now**: First question text appears in `content.message`
- **Structure**:
```json
{
  "type": "question",
  "content": {
    "message": "What topic would you like to present about?",  // ← Now populated!
    "context": "I need some additional information...",
    "question_id": "q_abc123",
    "questions": [...]  // Full question array still included
  }
}
```

### 3. ✅ Real AI Integration Ready
- OpenAI and Anthropic API keys configured
- System ready for real AI responses (once LangGraph import is fixed)
- Better logging to track AI vs Mock mode

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **LangGraph Import Issue**
   - System using MockWorkflow (simplified)
   - Real AI not fully active yet
   - Fix coming in Round 23

2. **No Changes Needed in Frontend**
   - All fixes are backend-side
   - Keep Round 21 message handling
