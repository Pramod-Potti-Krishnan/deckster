# CORS Fix Summary for Frontend Team

## What Was Fixed

The backend CORS configuration has been updated to allow your production domain (https://www.deckster.xyz) to connect to the API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Backend Code
- Modified `middleware.py` to read CORS origins from environment variables instead of hardcoding localhost
- This makes the backend flexible to accept different origins based on deployment environment

### 2. Updated Local Configuration
- Added production domains to the `.env` file for local testing
- Included wildcard support for Vercel preview deployments (`https://*.vercel.app`)

### 3. What You Need to Do

**IMPORTANT**: The backend team needs to update the Railway environment variables:

1. Go to Railway dashboard → Backend service → Variables tab
2. Add/Update this variable:
   ```
   CORS_ORIGINS=["https://www.deckster.xyz","https://deckster.xyz","https://*.vercel.app","http://localhost:3000","http://localhost:5173"]
   ```
3. Railway will automatically redeploy

## Testing After Deployment

Once the Railway environment is updated:

1. Your production site at https://www.deckster.xyz should be able to:
   - Fetch JWT tokens from `/api/dev/token`
   - Connect to the WebSocket at `/ws`
   - Make all API calls without CORS errors

2. The errors you were seeing:
   ```
   Access to fetch at 'https://deckster-production.up.railway.app/api/dev/token' 
   from origin 'https://www.deckster.xyz' has been blocked by CORS policy
   ```
   Should be resolved.

## Quick Test

After Railway is updated, test with:

```javascript
// This should now work from https://www.deckster.xyz
const response = await fetch('https://deckster-production.up.railway.app/api/dev/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ user_id: 'test_user' })
});

const { access_token } = await response.json();
console.log('Got token!', access_token);
```

## Support

If you still see CORS errors after the Railway update:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Check that the exact domain matches (with or without www)
3. Contact the backend team with the exact error message
