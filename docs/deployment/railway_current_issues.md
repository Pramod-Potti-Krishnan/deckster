# Current Railway Deployment Issues

## Date: July 4, 2025

## Issues Identified

### 1. CORS Origins Contains Semicolons
**Problem**: Railway is adding semicolons to some CORS origins
```
['https://www.deckster.xyz';, 'https://deckster.xyz';, 'https://*.vercel.app', 'http://localhost:3000';, 'http://localhost:5173';]
```

**Fixed**: Updated parser to remove semicolons
```python
cleaned = v.replace(';', '')
```

### 2. Logfire Not Available
**Problem**: Logfire package not loading despite being in requirements.txt
- Warning: "logfire not available, using standard logging"
- Package is listed in requirements.txt (logfire==3.22.0)

**Possible Causes**:
1. Railway build cache issue
2. Package installation failed silently
3. Python version incompatibility

**Solutions to Try**:
1. Force rebuild without cache in Railway
2. Check Railway build logs for logfire installation errors
3. Verify Python version compatibility

### 3. Environment Variable Format Issues
**Current Railway Format**:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=https://www.deckster.xyz,https://deckster.xyz,https://*.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
```

**Railway might be**:
- Adding escape characters
- Converting special characters
- Applying shell escaping

## Immediate Actions

1. **Push the semicolon fix**
   - Already updated in settings.py
   - Will clean semicolons from CORS origins

2. **Debug Logfire Installation**
   - Check Railway build logs for errors
   - Consider adding pip install debug output to Dockerfile

3. **Test Alternative CORS Format**
   - Try using pipe-separated: `url1|url2|url3`
   - Or space-separated with quotes: `"url1 url2 url3"`

## Next Deployment Test

After pushing current fixes:
1. Monitor if semicolons are removed
2. Check if logfire loads properly
3. Test CORS with the health endpoint
