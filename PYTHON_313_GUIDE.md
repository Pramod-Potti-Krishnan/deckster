# Python 3.13 Installation Guide

You're using Python 3.13 which is very new (released October 2024). While many packages now support it, Windows wheels might not be available for all packages yet.

## Option 1: Try Latest Versions (Recommended)

These packages have confirmed Python 3.13 support with Windows wheels:

```bash
# Use the safe requirements file
pip install -r requirements-py313-safe.txt

# Or use the installation script
bash install_py313.sh
```

## Option 2: Fallback Installation

If the above fails, use the Python script that installs packages one by one:

```bash
python install_fallback.py
```

## Option 3: Install Rust (If You Want Everything)

Some packages like `tiktoken` and `pydantic-core` might need compilation. Install Rust:

1. Download from: https://rustup.rs/
2. Run the installer
3. Restart your terminal
4. Try pip install again

## Option 4: Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 (Most Compatible)

If you continue having issues, consider using an older Python version:

1. Download Python 3.11 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/
2. Install it alongside Python 3.13
3. Create venv with: `py -3.11 -m venv venv`
4. Use the original requirements.txt

## What's Happening?

- **Python 3.13 is very new** (October 2024)
- **Windows wheels** for some packages might not be built yet
- **Compilation required** for packages without pre-built wheels
- **Rust needed** for some Python packages (pydantic-core, tiktoken)

## Quick Test

After installation, test with:

```bash
python -c "import fastapi, pydantic, uvicorn; print('âœ… Core packages work!')"
```

## Minimal Working Setup

If you just want to get started quickly, these packages definitely work on Python 3.13 Windows:

- fastapi==0.115.14
- pydantic==2.11.7
- uvicorn==0.32.1
- redis==5.3.0
- openai==1.59.15
- python-dotenv==1.0.1

The app will work with just these, though some features may be limited.
